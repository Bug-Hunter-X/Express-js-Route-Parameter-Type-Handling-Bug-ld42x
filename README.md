# Express.js Route Parameter Type Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to handling route parameters. The issue arises when a route expects a specific data type for a parameter (e.g., an integer) but receives a different type (e.g., a string). This can lead to unexpected behavior, database errors, or application crashes.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that expects an integer user ID. However, if the route is accessed with a string ID (e.g., `/users/abc`), the application may throw an error or return incorrect results. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle route parameters using type checking and validation to prevent such errors.
